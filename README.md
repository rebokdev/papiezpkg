# papież-pkg
a simple meme package menager

to install

put .pope.sh in your home folder

in .bashrc add following line ```alias papieżpkg /home/youruser/.pope.sh```       replace youruser with you username from /home directory

create text file in your home directory called .popenames and give it permission to be executed

in .bashrc add following line ``` /home/youruser/.popenames```       replace youruser with you username from /home folder

in / directory create kremowkas directory with permission to read and write to anyone

well done you made it to the end

note: papieżpkg is still in alpha and can break its folders when there's and typo in name

like:

papieżpkg uninstall furefox

and package was named firefox

then it will delate /kremowkas and /home/youruser/.local/share/applications
